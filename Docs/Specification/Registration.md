# Registration
Registration of users is a main focus of the solution. It should be simple, and have an attractive layout. 


## Registration form
The registration of users should be as simple as possible, to enhance conversions from interest to decision. When an user registers, fields for this information should be provided:
* Name  (string 100 characters) - required
* Email (string 100 characters, validated as email) - required
* Mobile phone: (string 100 charaters, only +()0-9 allowed) - required
* Occupation/Position
* Employer
* Permission to be shown on public attendant list
* Comments to registration

## Products / add-ons
All events could have extra products which may be free or priced. The extra products are associated with the event in the admin interface. For the user registering, the products should be shown as options, with the possibility of adding them to the order. Some products may be mandatory, as conference fee (dagpakke?) or registration fee.

The total price of the order should be updated as soon as the user changes product selection.

## Later development
In later stages of development we would like the possibility of providing supplemental information after the confirmation of registration, which should be stored in the user profile. 
* Date of Birth
* Municipality
* Biography / information about the user
* Website /Social media profile links
